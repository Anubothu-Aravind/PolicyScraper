# utils/text_utils.py
# Currently empty placeholder module for shared text utility functions.
# Potential future additions:
#   - Normalization (unicode cleanup, whitespace collapsing)
#   - Token counting / truncation helpers
#   - Safe substring operations preserving sentence boundaries
#   - Language detection wrappers
#   - Currency / number normalization
#
# Add implementations here as the project evolves.
